<h4>1.1 - Describe the content and layout for each page.</h4>
<p>
  <b> My content is laid out in the following ways: </b><br>
<br>I split the website into four separate pages; a homepage with the subheading “About this Blogroll’, ‘Unit One,’ ‘Unit Two,’ and ‘About Me’. This is so the reader lands on the page the reason why this website exists to it is clear, what I am introducing the reader to.<br>
<br>I have chosen to replicate the navigation bar at the end of each webpage for ease of navigation. This means the reader wouldn’t have to scroll all the way back to the top to view the navigation bar, in order to proceed to the next webpage once they get to the end, having finished reading their current webpage. <br>
<br>For the setup, I indented the paragraphs from the title and this provides “white space” in between each paragraph while the subheading acts as separator for each talking point. This gives each component to the content a clear definition while relating the content to the subheading clearly. <br>
<br>For my research, not only have I referenced each statement with a hyperlink to the website of their respective references, if the reader hovers over the reference and hyperlink they have they have an opportunity to see the exact quote and reference source, as I have coded the reference [typed within the box parenthesis] to contain the reference with respective quotes inside and appreciation for each reference, and included the link at these instances. This is this is far providing link gives an opportunity for the reader reader for further reading. <br>
<br>In case the website link is broken or the website no longer exists, I have included a link to the specific quotes within the abbreviation for the reader.<br>
<br>The following is view of this website from a) Firefox browser and b) Safari browser:<br>
a)<a href="firefox.png"target="_blank">
  <img src="firefox.png" alt="A view of this website from Firefox :)" style="width:230.4px;height:86.2px;">
</a>
b)<a href="safari.png"target="_blank">
    <img src="safari.png" alt="A view of this website from Safari :)" style="width:330.25px;height:113.2px;">
  </a>
  

</p>
<h4>1.5 - Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h4>
<p>
  <b>There are three main laws governing the contents of websites so that people's rights are protected:</b><br>
  <br><b>Copyright</b> Laws protect the intellectual property (IP) of creators whereby the IP is owned by the creator and as such ownership laws apply to the IP.<br>
  <br><b>The Equality Act 2010</b> negates companies to provide an advantage OR disadvantage towards people who have a personals they identify with that is not changable. In this context, The Equality Act 2010 legislates inclusion towards people who have a disability, where companies are proactively required to provide levels of enhancement to the access to website content, which would they would otherwise not have access to because of their disability. To execute this to a high standard, there is plenty of guidance provided on the http://www.gov.uk website.<br>
  <br><b>General Data Protection Regulation May 2018</b>(GDPR) legislates companies as strictly responsible to proactively protect the personal data of individuals from being used in a way the individual is unaware of, once this personal data is acquired by the company to provide their expected service. This data must be protected both physically (by locking it away) and digitally. This regulation also provides guidelines on how companies can practice due diligence when handling such sensitive data, and, allows a company do this efficiently, in a way that prevents such sensitive data from being exploited.

<h4>1.6 - Describing access issues that need taking into account.</h4>
<p>
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (known as WCAG 2.1) is a guideline of recommendations for making website accesible to a "wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities."
<abbr title="       REFERENCE  
        W3C Recommendation 05 June 2018,  
 
        Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Following these guidelines will also often make Web content more usable to users in general.

<br>In light of these guidelines, I propose to create more than one different view for this website. I propose having buttons at the top of this website so that the visitor can view the page in different colourways that would aid the reader to absorb the information as efficiently as possible. This protocol would be relevant to people who have impaired vision in the form of<abbr title="REFERENCE

  What is Irlen Syndrome?

  Irlen Syndrome (also referred to at times as Meares-Irlen Syndrome, Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome, and Visual Stress) is a perceptual processing disorder. It is not an optical problem. It is a problem with the brain’s ability to process visual information. This problem tends to run in families and is not currently identified by other standardized educational or medical tests.
