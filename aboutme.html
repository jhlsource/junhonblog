<h2> About Me</h2>
            <p> Let's start with “I know nothing”.</p>
            <p> Hi. My name is Jun-Hon Lau and i am a local to the Halifax area of West Yorkshire, England,
                United Kingdom. Growing up in the picturesque village of Hebden Bridge, a constant intention
                that has remained throughout my life has been connecting people to living their most joyful
                manifestation of it.</p>
            <p> My passions lie in the interception where craft and technique crosses expression. With
                a unique creative mind, I dedicate my life to the service of humanity reaching its highest
                form of self-expression.</p>
            <p> For positive and unique, outcome-based solutions, I invite you, dear reader, to follow
                me on my journey as I take my first steps in digital engineering featuring content I find
                inspiring.</p>
            <p> Why I'm interested in digital technology is the language can open up for myself and others
                who I can pass on my knowledge and sources that I learn from; apply my creative mind to my
                logic may find its natural expression in finding myself in a developer.
                An opportunity afforded to me through the enterprise: Code Nation, to whom I will be eternally
                grateful</p>
            <p> Current aptitudes include ballet, pattern draughting and manufacturing garments, design
                to "tech-pack", colour aptitude. Passions currently working towards include: mathematics,
                chemistry, computer science. aspiring future spaces for expansion: health, travel, cello,
                art (ceramics), technical consultation in information/digital technologies.</p>
