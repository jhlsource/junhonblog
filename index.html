<p>    <h4> About This Blogroll</h4>
    
    <p> Let's start with “I know nothing”.</p>
    <p> Hi. My name is Jun-Hon Lau and i am a local to the Halifax area of West Yorkshire, England, 
        United Kingdom. Growing up in the picturesque village of Hebden Bridge, a constant intention
        that has remained throughout my life has been connecting people to living their most joyful
        manifestation of it.</p>
    <p> My passions lie in the interception where craft and technique crosses expression. With 
        a unique creative mind, I dedicate my life to the service of humanity reaching its highest 
        form of self-expression.</p>
    <p> For positive and unique, outcome-based solutions, I invite you, dear reader, to follow 
        me on my journey as I take my first steps in digital engineering featuring content I find 
        inspiring.</p>
    <p> Why I'm interested in digital technology is the language can open up for myself and others 
        who I can pass on my knowledge and sources that I learn from; apply my creative mind to my 
        logic may find its natural expression in finding myself in a developer.
        An opportunity afforded to me through the enterprise: Code Nation, to whom I will be eternally 
        grateful.</p>
    <p> Current aptitudes include ballet, pattern draughting and manufacturing garments, design 
        to "tech-pack", colour aptitude. Passions currently working towards include: mathematics, 
        chemistry, computer science. aspiring future spaces for expansion: health, travel, cello, 
        art (ceramics), technical consultation in information/digital technologies.</p>

        7. Provide the project team members the tools and techniques the need to produce consistently successful projects.
        6. Manage and motivate people so that project efforts will experience a zone of optimal performance throughout its life.
        5. Include the customer at the beginning of the project and continually involve the customer as things change so that the required adjustments can be made together.
        4. Have a consistent methodology for planning and executing projects
        3. Have consistent processes for managing unambiguous checkpoints.
        2. Establish clear accountability for measured results.
        1. Focus on business value, not technical detail

        Challenge #1 - Lack of Visibility of all Projects. 
        Solution #1 - Publish Projects to a Visible Location.
        Challenge #2 - Unclear Project Objectives. 
        Solution #2 – Rank Project Initiatives.
        Challenge #3 - No Visibility into Resource Workload. 
        Solution #3 – Create a Resource Management Grid.
        Challenge #4 - Gaps in Communication. 
        Solution #4 – Provide a Centralized Location for Communication.
        Summary Solutions to these common issues are a combination of people, processes and tools. There is no 'magic button.' Good processes should be implemented that are customized for the business. If outside consultants need to be hired to help define these processes, then they should be brought on board. Software solutions that support these processes need to be utilized or invested in. Once invested in, the solutions need to be supported by top management.  Executive management must show leadership by spending the time it takes to plan, set goals and strategies, prior to embarking on projects. Project managers must be bold enough to contribute and give feedback when executives' expectations are unrealistic. Team members must get on board once projects have begun and task assignments have been communicated.*PMI is a registered trademark of Project Management Institute, Inc.

        "To digitally transform or run a successful digital project requires significant collaboration." Beyond this:
        1. Failing to account for business processes
        2. Failing to secure all executive buy-in
        3. Investing in shiny objects, not customer value
        4. Poor definition/expectations setting
        5. Poor vendor selection

        https://www.atlassian.com/git Git is a free and open source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Unlike older centralized version control systems such as SVN and CVS, Git is distributed: every developer has the full history of their code repository locally. This makes the initial clone of the repository slower, but subsequent operations such as commit, blame, diff, merge, and log dramatically faster.
        
        Git also has excellent support for branching, merging, and rewriting repository history, which has lead to many innovative and powerful workflows and tools. Pull requests are one such popular tool that allow teams to collaborate on Git branches and efficiently review each others code. Git is the most widely used version control system in the world today and is considered the modern standard for software development.
        
        Here is a basic overview of how Git works:
        Create a "repository" (project) with a git hosting tool (like Bitbucket)
        Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine
        Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes
        "Push" your changes to your master branch
        Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit
        "Pull" the changes to your local machine
        Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change
        Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the master branch)
        "Merge" your branch to the master branch
        Trello 
        Collaborate and get more done. Trello boards enable your team to organize projects in a fun, flexible, and visual way.
