       <p>    Why I'm interested in digital technology is what learning coding language can open up for
              people and how I can pass on my knowledge and the sources that I learn from. In the
              interests of finding myself, applying my creative mind to logic may find its natural
              expression in a developer. An opportunity afforded to me through the enterprise:
              Code Nation, to whom I will be eternally grateful.</p>

<p>Analytics are used as a tool to provide insights to create marketing strategies that enable 
    clients to target effectively their audience and hence help a business grow. This is about 
    staying relevant to your customer at every step of the journey, which parts of your communication

    What Makes a Modern Business Successful?
    
    Chances are good that you’re already using some type of analytic tools to monitor your traffic and sales numbers (if not, you really need to modernize a.s.a.p.) but did you know that your analytics can be doing more for you? Analytic software has improved significantly in the past few years and it can do more than just tell you how many people are visiting your homepage; it can also give you valuable insights into things like customer behavioral patterns and marketing performance. For example, Google Analytics can help identify holes in your sales funnel by telling you which pages are converting and which are underperforming, which types of users are visiting your site, what page they land on, where they go next, and how long they stay. With this data, you can create marketing strategies to target users more effectively and ultimately improve your sales funnel. But if you don’t take the time to use all of the features provided by your analytics software, you will end up missing out on potentially vital information that can help your business grow.

                    Summary of Solutions <br> to these common issues are a combination of people, processes and tools. There is no 'magic button.' Good processes should be implemented that are customized for the business. If outside consultants need to be hired to help define these processes, then they should be brought on board. Software solutions that support these processes need to be utilized or invested in. Once invested in, the solutions need to be supported by top management.  Executive management must show leadership by spending the time it takes to plan, set goals and strategies, prior to embarking on projects. Project managers must be bold enough to contribute and give feedback when executives' expectations are unrealistic. Team members must get on board once projects have begun and task assignments have been communicated.*PMI is a registered trademark of Project Management Institute, Inc.

       Author / Enginess Team: 11 September, 2018, ARTICLE, To digitally transform or run a successful digital project requires significant collaboration. Beyond this:
              1. Failing to account for business processes
              2. Failing to secure all executive buy-in
              3. Investing in shiny objects, not customer value
              4. Poor definition or expectations setting
              5. Poor vendor selection.

              Git is a free and open source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Unlike older centralized version control systems such as SVN and CVS, Git is distributed: every developer has the full history of their code repository locally. This makes the initial clone of the repository slower, but subsequent operations such as commit, blame, diff, merge, and log dramatically faster.
       
       Git also has excellent support for branching, merging, and rewriting repository history, which has lead to many innovative and powerful workflows and tools. Pull requests are one such popular tool that allow teams to collaborate on Git branches and efficiently review each others code. Git is the most widely used version control system in the world today and is considered the modern standard for software development..

              Here is a basic overview of how Git works:
              Create a "repository" (project) with a git hosting tool (like Bitbucket)
              Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine
              Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes
              "Push" your changes to your master branch
              Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit
              "Pull" the changes to your local machine
              Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change
              Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the master branch)
              "Merge" your branch to the master branch
              Trello
              Collaborate and get more done. Trello boards enable your team to organize projects in a fun, flexible, and visual way.

          <p>    <h2> About Me</h2>
          <p> Let's start with “I know nothing”.</p>
          <p> Hi. My name is Jun-Hon Lau and i am a local to the Halifax area of West Yorkshire, England,
              United Kingdom. Growing up in the picturesque village of Hebden Bridge, a constant intention
              that has remained throughout my life has been connecting people to living their most joyful
              manifestation of it.</p>
          <p> My passions lie in the interception where craft and technique crosses expression. With
              a unique creative mind, I dedicate my life to the service of humanity reaching its highest

          <p> For positive and unique, outcome-based solutions, I invite you, dear reader, to follow
              me on my journey as I take my first steps in digital engineering featuring content I find
              inspiring.</p>
          <p> Why I'm interested in digital technology is the language can open up for myself and others
              who I can pass on my knowledge and sources that I learn from; apply my creative mind to my
              logic may find its natural expression in finding myself in a developer.
              An opportunity afforded to me through the enterprise: Code Nation, to whom I will be eternally
              grateful</p>
          <p> Current aptitudes include ballet, pattern draughting and manufacturing garments, design
              to "tech-pack", colour aptitude. Passions currently working towards include: mathematics,
              chemistry, computer science. aspiring future spaces for expansion: health, travel, cello,
              art (ceramics), technical consultation in information/digital technologies.</p>
